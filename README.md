# MAGE
Main Page for the Mobile Awareness GEOINT Environment

MAGE provides a dynamic capability for rapidly deploying a mobile situational awareness capability in secure environments; that supports low-bandwidth and disconnected users. By leveraging a service based architecture it has the ability to integrate with existing command centers and common operating pictures or stands alone as a full mission ready solution.
MAGE provides users the ability to create and share observations (including attached videos, photos, and audio recordings) in the field using a mobile device. Additionally, the data collection form can be easily customized to suit the mission at hand. MAGE also supports the reporting of field agentâ€™s locations at regular intervals to a central server (this is optional and can be turned off in situations where it is not needed).
